# Contributing Guide

Thank you for contributing to this repository!
This repository holds the locale files for all scripts sold on my [tebex store](https://maximus-scripts.tebex.io). To maintain consistency and quality, please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing.

---

## General Guidelines

1. **Follow the `en.json` Structure**  
    All locale files must follow the structure defined in the parent `en.json` files. This ensures uniformity across translations.

    - Keys and their hierarchy should match exactly.

2. **Indentation**  
    Use **4 spaces** for indentation in all JSON files.

3. **One File per Commit**  
    Each commit should only include changes to a single locale file. This makes it easier to review and track changes.

    - If you are updating multiple locale files, separate the changes into distinct commits.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository
- Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mps-locales.git
```

### 2. Create a New Branch (optional - best practice)
- Create a branch for your contribution:
```bash
git checkout -b update-locale-[resource-name]
```
Replace `[resource-name]` with the resource concerned with your contributions, if updating multiple resources using a more generic name is also appropriate.

### 3. Make Your Changes
- Update the locale file following the structure of `en.json`.
- Validate the JSON file to ensure there are no syntax errors.

### 4. Commit Your Changes
- Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
    Replace resource with the resource name (the parent folder i.e. `mps-tickets`)

    ```bash
    git add [resource]/[locale-code].json
    git commit -m "chore([resource]/[locale-code]): updated locale file"
    ```

### 5. Push and Create a Pull Request
- Push your branch to your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin update-locale-[locale-code]
    ```
- Open a pull request (PR) to the main repository.

## Pull Request Requirements

1. **Describe Your Changes**  
    Clearly describe the updates made in your PR. For example:
    ```
    Updated `fr.json` from `mps-tickets` to include translations for new keys added in `en.json`.
    ```

2. **Pass All Checks**  
    Ensure your contribution:
    - Adheres to the parent `en.json` structure.
    - Uses 4-space indentation.
    - Includes only one file change per commit.
